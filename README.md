# [DEPRECATED] Amino Scripts.

Since the Python API for Amino ended up not being updated anymore, this project will no longer be maintained. 

It had a bunch of scripts to automate activity in Amino's App. This including:

+ Update profile background and description with current playback on Spotify through their API connection.
+ An automated script to claim coins in more than one account.
+ An automated script to like recent wikis or blogs.
+ A script to delete comments from a profile's wall, include comments that were not visible through Amino's phone app.
